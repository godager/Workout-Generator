# Workout-Generator
Generates strength training workout routines based on user input. Users login information and exercises are stored in a local database.
To use the software you have to set up a PostgreSQL database by running the SQL scripts from the directory "SQLCreate&InsertScripts".

Demo without database will be uploaded soon.
